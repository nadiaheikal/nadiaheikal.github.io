<p>I could draw several commonalities between the <i>“Long Live the Web”</i> article and <i>The Atlantic’s “As We May Think."</i>
    The perspectives offered in the articles were fresh, thought-provoking, and perhaps a little out-of-the-box, 
    despite the date of their publishing being several decades apart.</p>

   <p> In Vannevar Bush’s essay <i>“As We May Think,”</i> he conceives this notion of the <b>“memex”</b> which is an imaginary device
    that is used to store one’s information which consists of anything from books and film to communication files. 
    I found it particularly interesting that the writer compared the <b>“memex”</b> to a desk as though he is foreshadowing 
    the future. When I visualize the <b></b>“memex,”</b> I see an external hard drive. One where you have vast amounts of information
    from books and poetry to films and music for entertainment, all stored on a small external device. I turned the 
    description of the <b>“memex”</b> into a riddle whilst going through this article. What projects knowledge? What has a screen? 
    What can store immeasurable amounts of information? When I thought of all these factors, I realized that an external 
    hard drive is not what Bush was describing. I envisioned what this device could be and realized a desktop device 
    communicates all these elements and more.</p>

   <p> There is one thing that I found deficient in Bush’s description of the <b>“memex,"</b>" and that was that he disregarded the
    value of personal memories and experiences. I believe that these personal recollections are of equal importance to any
    knowledge that is available to the public. If there was one thing, I had the ability to preserve that would be my memories.
    I want to be able to keep them fresh in my mind, keep them close to my heart, and revisit them as I grow older. My past 
    experiences, both academically and social, have as much value to me than anything that can be found online. They are 
    momentsthat I have learned from, encouraged me and that have made me resilient. Bush overlooked the power of one’s own 
    experiences, and I believe they are worthy of being stored within the <b>“memex.”</b>

<p><b>My life is essentially on the Web.</b> When I say this, I am not referring to my personal information or my personal thoughts
    and feelings (although that is probably out there too). What I mean is that the Web is essential to my life. I use it to
    access my university’s portal so I can study, do my homework, and access other academic resources. I use it for my
    entertainment to stream videos, listen to music, and so on. I use it to communicate with my loved ones, wherever they may
    be on this Earth. It aids my personal growth as an individual and allows me to get the human connection I need. In Tim
    Burns-Lee essay, <i></i>“Long Live the Web,”</i> he mentions that the Web is now being threatened. Prior to this reading, I never
    imagined that something so fundamental to my life was in danger. </p>

    <p>Growing up, I never had experienced any form of democracy in my life. My dad was the leader of the household and anything
        he says goes. My academic life was guided by a series of dictators who decided which classes I should take and what is 
        best for me despite them not even knowing my name. Additionally, living in a corrupt country didn’t help my odds either. 
        My first taste of freedom was in the late 2000’s when I decided to make my own Tumblr page. I made the playlist, I chose
        the aesthetics of my page, and I chose what imagery I wanted to feature on it. To imagine that my freedom could be censored
        would crush younger me. The present-day Nadia understands the intentions behind why my freedom of speech may be suppressed. 
        I understand why my information and online habits are being monitored, and why social networks are walling me off from 
        information being posted. Do I like this new mode of supervision? Absolutely not, but at least I know some of the reasoning
        behind it. It’s one big propaganda which is meant to sway the user in one direction or the other. Unfortunately, <b>I do not 
        see how things can be reversed.</b> I believe governments and industries alike have gone too far, and their effects cannot be
        reversed. </p>
