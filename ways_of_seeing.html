      <p style="color: white;">Initially, I struggled to see how John Berger’s Ways of Seeing would tie into our class. What do European oil paintings have to do with web development? Ways of Seeing was released in 1972 whilst the World Wide Web was invented in 1990, but surely there is a connection between the traditions of European oil paints and the content of the class.</p>  

      <p style="color:white;">The thing is, it’s not about the oil painting itself. It’s about the content of the painting and how it reflects the way we live, the way we want to be perceived, and how we perceive ourselves. The tradition that began in the 1400’s and died in the 1900’s was about the convention of perspective. It died with the invention of the camera which made each individual painting less unique because they became transmissible. People no longer had to travel to see extravagant pieces of art because they could be anywhere at any time. If you wanted to see the Mona Lisa then you don’t have to travel to Paris to see it, a simple Google search will exhibit the Mona Lisa on your screen in a matter of seconds. This seems to be part of the evolution of technology where old practices become redundant and lose some, if not all, their meaning. For example, I think of VHS cassettes that became DVDs that eventually became a streaming service (like, Netflix). It’s the circle of life, really.</p>
     
      <p style="color: white;">John Berger addressed a common theme seen in European art: the objectified nude woman. The murals of women that bestow the canvas are versions if the idealized woman. Their figures are draped atop of furniture, and their faces look back at the spectator implying an awareness of the viewer as though they are playing “a role.” Berger quite literally states, “the prize is to be owned” and that they are meant to “feed an appetite and not have any of their own.” Understandably, this is not his own stance of the image but a description of the purpose they are serving. Hundreds of years later, the nude woman is still a central focus in our modern-day culture, often used as an object of seduction with pornographic undertones. The nude woman serves the same purpose they did during the 1400’s to 1900’s. I find it very frustrating to see that our culture’s essence has not advanced. Women are still being exploited as sexual objects to commercialize and sell, whilst the core of the person in photograph is neglected.</p>

      <p style="color: white;" style="font-size: 18px;">The purpose of the painting was to convey wealth through the components that made the picture like, gold, land, jewelry, and other valuable merchandise. The ownership brought confidence, implied wealth and power, and brought about envy from others. But as time moves on, this tradition has been broken and replaced with publicity. Today, we are constantly surrounded by images that promise an alternate way of living. In the consumer society of today, publicity promises that we can change and improve our lives by buying “something” more. The tangible “things” are promised to give us a feeling of opulence and wealth, but in reality, by purchasing that “thing” we are poorer than we were before. The tradition of the oil painting is now replaced with the art of photography. The idea of “you are what you have” lives on. </p>

      <p style="color: white;">Publicity pushes consumers to aspire a better life than the one we have. In our world, “money is magic,” and those who possess it are the glamourous ones, the ones who the masses should envy. The products are positioned to work with people’s imagination. For example, objects are made more desirable by being place in “exotic” places to captivate the viewer. Yet, as individuals, we neglect the disconnection between the magazine pages where things are ever so strongly publicized between the pages of the hard-hitting articles. The glamourous images are juxtaposed by war imagery, making reality undistinguishable. I believe as a society we lack a certain level of self-awareness. We are consumed by the next best thing, and hardly satisfied with the life we have. Above that, we are so consumed with being “included” that we disregard what is really going in the world. The power of imagery and words that is publicity makes up our culture. We believe we want what is being publicized and those wants are confused with our needs. It seems that we are exactly where we were hundreds of years ago where we are preoccupied by the things that make us interesting or alter people’s perception of us. Only difference now that instead of oil paintings available in private domains is that the publicized images cover every corner our lives ever reminding us of our inadequacy. </p>
